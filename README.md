- 👋 Hi, I’m Keshav Sharma
- @Keshav2136
- Making web apps and learning about hardware stuff excites me.
- I want to be known as the Linux guy, coz I run Linux and make videos on it.
- I have worked on many OpenCV projects like Face Recognition and Speech recognition and used & and trained some models on Google's Tensorflow and other AI/ML models, I usually post my work on my youtube channel. My youtube channel will tell you more about the projects I've worked upon. So I suggest having a look there.
- These are just a few lines which don't describe me well. So I'll say to have a look at Linux Tennyson (my youtube channel) and you will see how OpenCV works and why linux is just great.
