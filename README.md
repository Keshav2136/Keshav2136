Hi there! My name is Keshav Sharma and I am a university student with a passion for **web development** and a curious mind for ethical hacking and drones. I have been working with _PHP and MySQL_ for a few years now and have tried my hand at some exciting ML and OpenCV projects like _face recognition and pose estimation_.

I love sharing my knowledge and experiences with others, so I have documented and made tutorials on YouTube for anyone interested in learning from my work. Apart from web development, I am also interested in ethical hacking and drones, and I am always looking to improve my skills and knowledge in these areas.
